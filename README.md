# web-hashtag-trending
App to visualize social media trends on a map.

# Frontend
A basic React/TypeScript implementation with help of d3.js to create a minimalistic and responsive custom map. Map is rather heavy and optionally OSM based map with suitable themed (e.g. MapBox & dark-v10) tilelayer can be used.

# Backend
NestJS based implementation was chosen because of the TypeScript's safe approach continuum from the frontend.For data caching; Redis integration is coming up - to get broader averagings from wider datasets in use.

# Other notes
This application is a prototype version only.

Docker support to come alongside with CI/CD shipping.
